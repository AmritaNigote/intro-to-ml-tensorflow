    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "* If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset? You must use the code cell below and assign your results to `'accuracy'` and `'fscore'` to be used later.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    " One real world application in industry where the model can be applied is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cibil score of an user generated based on certain conditions.This model uses decision trees to provide the appropriate cibil score to the customer \n",
    "\n",
    "* Explaination: If a user is able to pay his credit card amount within the time interval provided then probably his cibil score will be better else cibil score will be less.\n",
    "* If user takes credit card loans, emi on time and uses often credit cards then cibil score will be more else cibil score will be low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths of a model and when it performs well:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision trees require relatively little effort from users for data preparation.\n",
    "* Non-linear relatonships between parameters do not affect tree performance.\n",
    "* The number of hyper-parameters to be tuned is almost null.\n",
    "* Data type is not a constraint.i.e. it can handle both numerical data and categorical data.\n",
    "* Decision trees implicitly perform variable screening or feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness of the model and when does it perform poorly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Over-fitting: Decision-tree learners can create over-complex tres that do not generalize the data well.\n",
    "* Not fit for continous variables.\n",
    "* Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated.\n",
    "* Calculations can become complex when there are many class label.\n",
    "        \n",
    "What makes this model a good candidate for the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision tree search for the solution to a decision based on certain conditions.Here,Categorical features like- workclass, education_level, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race,sex, native-country can divide itself into multiple branches and searched for a solution based on conditions for example for education_level(if the education_level is higher person will earn >50K else person will earn <50K)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numerical features like age,education-num,capital-gain,capital-loss, hours-per-week as it is a continous data, boundaries can be made based on the most important feature condition.For example: (if a person has higher education-num is more likely to earn >50K else person will earn <50K) \n",
    "\n",
    "Reference:)https://www.xoriant.com/blog/product-engineering/decision-trees-machine-learning-algorithm.html\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) SVM (Support Vector Machine)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Real world example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SVM is used to classify satellite remotely sensed and multispectral data.\n",
    "* Explaination : The data are recorded from a landsat-5 TM satellite with resolution of 30*30 m. SVM finds optimal separating hyperplane between classes by focussing on training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths of a model and when does it perform well:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SVM are very good when we have no idea on the data. It works well with even unstructured and semi structured data like text, images and trees.SVM algorithm uses a set of mathematical functions that are defined as kernel. The function of kernel is to take data as input and transform it into the required form and these functions can be of different types like Linear, Sigmoid, RBF, non-linear, polynomial.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Weakness of a model and when does it perform poorly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SVM algorithm is not suitable for large data sets. \n",
    "* It does not perform very well when the data set has more noise i.e target classess are overlapping.\n",
    "* Also, in cases where number of features for each data point exceeds the number of training data sample the          svm will underperform.\n",
    "* As the support vector classifier works by putting data points above and below the classifying hyperplane there is no probabilistic explaination for the classification\n",
    "        \n",
    "What makes this model a good candidate for the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Census data contains many categorical features which can be divided directly into to show whether the person makes more than 50K on individual basis. When these features are combined to plot on higher dimension, SVM can find hyperplane which can divide the data to get the binary output.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Reference: https://monkeylearn.com/blog/introduction-to-support-vector-machines-svm/ and Udacity course videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.)AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 1:) One real world application in industry where the model can be applied is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the Viola-Jones object detection algorithm, the training process used AdaBoost to select a subset of features and construct a classifier.A large set of images, with size corresponding to the size of the detection window is prepared. This set must contain positive example for the desired filtered and negative examples(non faces).\n",
    "* The main property of this algorithm is that training is slow, but detection is fast.The efficiency of the viola jones algorithm can be significantly increased by first generating the integral image.\n",
    "   \n",
    " Answer 2) Strengths of a model and when does it perform well:\n",
    " \n",
    " * Adaboost can be used with nu,ber of classifications. It is flexible to combine with any machine learning algorithm. It is fast and simple.\n",
    "     \n",
    "Answer 3.)Weakness of a model and when does it perform poorly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weak classifiers may lead to overfitting.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Answer 4.)What makes this model a good candidate for the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Census data may have many features which individually effect the target label, like occupations, Age, education level relationship status, etc. These data can create good weak models as some of these models may have higher weightage in contributing the final outcome.\n",

    "* AdaBoost uses an iterative approah to learn from the mistakes of weak classifiers and then turn them into stronger ones.i.e like a weak classifier is made on top of a training data based on the weighted samples. Here teh weight of each sample indicate how important it is to be correctly classified.Initially for the first decision stump, we give all the samples equal weights.\n",
    "* We create a decision stump for each variables and see how well each stump classfies samples to their target classes.\n",
    "* More weight is assigned to the incorrectly classified samples so that they are classified correctly into the next decision stump.\n",
    "* Weight is also assigned to each classifier based on the accuracy of the classifier which means \"high accuracy = high weight.We need to iterate untill all the points have been correctl classified or the maximum iteration level has been reached.\n",
    "* AdaBoost can work with any machine learning algorithm as a weak learner. MOst commonly used wek learner is Decision Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are weak learners?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A weak learner is defined to be classfier that is only slightly correlated with the true classification.The weak learner in AdaBoost are decision tree with a single split called decision stumps.\n",
    " \n",
    "Why to use Decision trees in AdaBoost:\n",
    " \n",
    "* Decision trees are non linear.Boosting with linear model simply does not work well.\n",
    "* The weak learner needs to be consistently better than random guessing.We don't normal need to do any parameter tuning to decision tree to get that situation.\n",
    "* Decision trees are reasonably fast to train,since we are ging to be building 100s or 1000s of them, that is a good property.They are also fast to classify which is again important when we need 100s or 1000s to run before we can output our decision.\n",
    "* By changing  the depth we can  have a simple and easy control over the bias/variance trade off.\n",
    "* Boosting works very well with weak learners. The boosting weak learners have high bias and low variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "How boosting is used for training and predictin on given census data?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Boosting makes subsets of our census data and creates weak learners on them.\n",
    "* for example: If we take age, if age is less, then it is more likely that person will earn less than 50k because many companies beileve more age is equivalent to more experience and highly experience person will get compatively higher salaries.Likewise if age is more than person will earn more than 50K.\n",
    "* Similarly in case of hours-per-week which shows the number of hours person works, if the hour-per-week is more the person will earn more and if it is lows person earns less. So, for these two their will be two different weak learnerrs created and each will decide based on the values of the features. Also,as these two are inversly proportional, if one is high the other goes down.\n",
    "* Let us take another example : Like, if we take capital loss, if loss is low than it is more likely that person will earn 50K or if it is more high the person will earn less.\n",
    "* Like this Boosting will create weak learners on all the features and weight then baseeatured on their importance and in the end cmbine them to get final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whfat does feature importance means and how they are calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature importance refers to techniques that assign a score to input features based on how useful they are at predicting a target variable.\n",
    "* Feature importance is calculated as the decreasein node impurityweighhted by the probability of reaching that node. The node probability can be calculated by the number of samples that reach the node, divided by the total number of samples. The higher the value the more important the feature.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
